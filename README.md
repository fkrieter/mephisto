**MakE Pretty HISTOgrams**


Mephisto aims to deliver a smoother and more intuitive workflow for making plots with the python extension of the [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) Data Analysis Framework.
By enhancing the functionality of the fundamental classes implemented in ROOT and offering simple and efficient I/O solutions for frequent tasks the user can hopefully dedicate more time to *make pretty histograms!*
