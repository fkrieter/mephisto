    "We have now set the y-axis to a linear scale, increased the line thickness of the histogram, added an errorband (computed by ```TH1::Sumw2```) and added custom x-axis title and associated units. It would of course be possible to customize the plot even further: You can give ```Print``` or the Histo1D constructor itself any **property** associated to a Histo1D.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are properties?\n",
    "\n",
    "The short answer is, (almost) any attribute of a class for which there is a setter method. For example, a Histo1D object has a setter called ```SetLineWidth``` that takes one integer as an argument. Thus ```linewidth``` is a *property* of a Histo1D object and you can define it either by using the setter method or give it as a keyword argument to the class constructor, the ```Print``` method or the ```DeclareProperty```/```DeclareProperties``` method. If you'd like to change a properties of the errorband associated to the histogram you simply need to add the prefix ```errorband``` to the name of the property, like we did by ```errorbandfillstyle=3151``` above. The same hold for properties of the associated Legend (inherits from TLegend): Just add the prefix ```legend``` in fron of the property name!\n",
    "\n",
    "If a setter required more than one argument, like ```SetFillColorAlpha``` for example, the value associated to the given keyword argument must be a ```list``` or ```tuple```. Color values can be either integers (i.e. also of the form ```ROOT.kColor```) or strings containing a hex-code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some setters, like ```SetBinContent``` for example, that are not associated with a property for safety reasons. The ```name``` property also does not exist in order to keep track of the histogram that are created by the user. Since the methods like ```SetXTitle``` exist for both in the Histo1D and in the Pad (inherits from TPad) class, the associated properties have been made exclusive for Pad objects. You can steer it however via the ```Print``` method which propagates it to the Pad in which the histogram is drawn.\n",
